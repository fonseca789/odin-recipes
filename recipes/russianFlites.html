            </li>
            <li>

                Squeeze the juice of one lemon and mix it with the meat, avoiding the seeds.
            </li>
            <li>

                Add the spices and salt to the meat.
            </li>

                Once everything is mixed, make medium-sized balls with the meat, flatten them and roll them in the egg
                and breadcrumbs. If you want, when you finish this step you can freeze them to have them later.
